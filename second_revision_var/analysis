VaR-WVaR

From the standpoint of the number of stocks:
In Paper we say, smaller number of stocks perform inferior to that of higher number of stocks.

Current observation:

From tables:

BSE30vsBSE100
In real data, n=31 is superior
In simulated data, n=98 is superior

FTSE100vsFTSE350
In both cases, smaller number is superior

Nikkei225 vs Nikkei400:
In both cases, larger number is superior

SNP100vsSNP500
In real data, snp500 is superior
In simulated data, snp100 is superior.

From figures:
WVar outperforms VaR for bse30, bse10, ftse100, snp100, snp500 (both market and simulated).
VaR outperforms WVaR for ftse350, nikkei225, nikkei400 (both market and simulated)
So, the standpoint is not met.

From the standpoint of type of data:

In paper we say, base VaR and the WVaR models exhibits superior performance in the case of real market data
than the simulated data.
Here also our standpoint is not met. 
In all cases except snp500, results in simulated data are better than the real market data (from the avg values in the tables).
