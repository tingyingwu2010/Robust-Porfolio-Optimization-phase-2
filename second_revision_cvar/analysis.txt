CVaR-WCVaR

From the standpoint of the number of stocks:

In paper we say that for market data, performance of both CVaR and WCVaR improve as number of stocks increases. But, CVaR continues to outperform WCVar. 
For simulated data, performance of both CVaR and WCVaR decline with increase in stocks. But, WCVaR continues to outperform CVaR.

Current observation:

From tables:

BSE30vsBSE100

bse30_market: 0.0938,0.0837,-0.0101 (l=5)
bse30_simulated: 0.095,0.104,0.00891 (l=3)

bse100_simulated: 0.0956,0.0968,0.00123 (l=2)

In real data, performance declines with increase in N. (CVaR continues to outperform)
In simulated data, performance almost remains same with increase in N. (WCVaR continues to outperform marginally)

FTSE100vsFTSE350

ftse100_market: 0.0293,0.0273,-0.00197 (l=4)

ftse350_simulated: 0.0444,0.0438,-0.000604 (l=2)

In real data, performance declines with increase in N. (WCVaR outperforms with increase in N)
In simulated data, performance declines with increase in N. (WCVaR continues to perform almost equivalent wrt. CVaR)

Nikkei225 vs Nikkei400:

nikkei225_market: -0.0202,0.00195,0.0221 (l=5)

nikkei400_simulated: 0.0332,0.0351,0.00196 (l=4)

In real data, performance improves with increase in N. (CVaR outperforms with increase in N)
In simulated data, performance improves with increase in N. (WCVaR continues to outperform marginally)

SNP100vsSNP500

snp100_market: 0.0464,0.0469,0.000489 (l=3)
snp100_simulated: 0.101,0.0919,-0.00865 (l=2)

snp500_simulated: 0.0429,0.0447,0.00181 (l=5)

In real data, performance almost remains same with increase in N. (CVaR outperforms marginally with increase in N)
In simulated data, performance declines with increase in N. (WCVaR outperforms marginally with increase in N)

From figures:
CVar outperforms CVaR for bse30_market, bse100_market, nikkei400_market, snp100_simulated, snp500_market
WCVaR outperforms WCVaR for bse30_simulated, bse100_simulated, ftse350_market, nikkei225_market
Almost Equivalent Performance for ftse100_market, ftse100_simulated, ftse350_simulated, nikkei225_simulated, nikkei400_simulated, snp100_market, snp500_simulated

#No pattern is observed and our standpoint is not met.

From the standpoint of type of data:


In paper we observe from Table 20 that base CVaR and the WCVaR models exhibit superior performance in the case of simulated data than the market data (the outperformance of WCVaR wrt. CVaR is more for simulated than market).

Current observation:

From tables:

BSE30vsBSE100

CVaR and WCVaR exhibit superior performance in the case of simulated data than the market data (the outperformance of WCVaR wrt. CVaR is more for simulated than market overall) .

FTSE100vsFTSE350

CVaR and WCVaR exhibit superior or equivalent performance in the case of simulated data than the market data (outperformance of WCVar wrt. CVaR is more for market than simulated for ftse350) .

Nikkei225 vs Nikkei400:

CVaR and WCVaR exhibit superior or equivalent performance in the case of simulated data than the market data (outperformance of WCVar wrt. CVaR is more for market than simulated for nikkei225) .

SNP100vsSNP500

CVaR and WCVaR exhibit superior or equivalent performance in the case of simulated data than the market data (outperformance of WCVar wrt. CVaR is more for market than simulated for snp100) .

Here our standpoint is partially met.
